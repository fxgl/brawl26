# Creating Filters (Legacy) [![](Logo-Tiny.png)](/../../#glossary)

> **Warning**
> This is legacy filters in ME.ECS. Turn on FILTERS_STORAGE_LEGACY define to use this filter type.

In ME.ECS filters are storing entities with the certain components they have or not.
Filters must be created in OnConstruct methods and shouldn't be added at the runtime.
By default in **System with Filter** you have already defined filter and have an AdvanceTick method to implement logic working with certain entity.

But sometimes you need to create filters manually in constructors like this:
```csharp
Filter filter;

void ISystemBase.OnConstruct() {

    Filter.Create("YourFilterName").With<MyStructComponent>().Without<MyComponent>().Push(ref this.filter);

}
```

You can use these methods to filter your entities:
> All methods are combined with **AND** operator

| Method | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| ```With<T>``` | Filters all entities having T component |
| ```Without<T>``` | Filters all entities that don't have T component |
| ```WithShared<T>``` | Filter works only if static shared T component exists |
| ```WithoutShared<T>``` | Filter works only if static shared T component doesn't exist |
| ```OnVersionChangedOnly``` | Filtered only entities if its version has changed. filter.ToArray() and filter.GetEnumerator() resets these versions. |

## Multiple Filters
MultipleFilters - it is the solution which combines two filters inside and allows to filter Any<T0, T1> or WithoutAny<T0, T1> components:
```csharp
MultipleFilter filter;

void ISystemBase.OnConstruct() {

    MultipleFilter.Create("YourMultipleFilterName").Any<Component1, Component2>().Push(ref this.filter);

}
```

You can use these methods to filter your entities:
> All methods are combined with **AND** operator

| Method | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| ```With<T>``` | Filters all entities having T component |
| ```Without<T>``` | Filters all entities that don't have T component |
| ```Any<T0, T1>``` | Filters all entities having T0 or T1 component |
| ```WithoutAny<T0, T1>``` | Filters all entities that don't have T0 and T1 component |
| ```OnVersionChangedOnly``` | Filtered only entities if its version has changed. filter.ToArray() and filter.GetEnumerator() resets these versions. |

## Filter Actions
Define: **ENTITY_ACTIONS**

In ME.ECS you could use SetOnEntityAdd/SetOnEntityRemove for filters, but on high level you can use FilterAction class to automatically receive onAdd/onRemove callbacks as System.Action:

```csharp
void ISystemBase.OnConstruct() {

    FilterAction.Create(onAdd: (entity) => {
        // Here is your code
    }, onRemove: (entity) => {
        // Here is your code
    }, customName: "YourFilterActionName").With<MyStructComponent>().Without<MyComponent>().Push();

}
```

As you see, all default With/Without filters can be used in FilterAction as in Filter.
