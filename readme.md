public class PlayerFeature : Feature {
    protected override void OnConstruct() {
        // Player movement
        AddSystem<PlayerInputSystem>();
        AddSystem<PlayerMovementSystem>();
        
        // Player combat
        AddSystem<PlayerAimSystem>();
        AddSystem<PlayerShootingSystem>();
        
        // Player state
        AddSystem<PlayerHealthSystem>();
    }
}

public class ProjectileFeature : Feature {
    protected override void OnConstruct() {
        AddSystem<ProjectileMovementSystem>();
        AddSystem<ProjectileLifetimeSystem>();
        AddSystem<ProjectileCollisionSystem>();
    }
}

public class NetworkFeature : Feature {

                    UnityEngine.Input.GetAxis("Vertical")
                ).normalized;
                
                // Get mouse position for aiming
                Vector3 mousePos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(UnityEngine.Input.mousePosition);
                ref var pos = ref entity.Get<PositionComponent>();
                Vector2 direction = new Vector2(mousePos.x - pos.value.x, mousePos.y - pos.value.y).normalized;
                input.aim = direction;
                
                // Detect shooting input

    public void OnDeconstruct() {}
    
    public void OnUpdate(float deltaTime) {
        foreach (var entity in this.playerFilter) {
            ref var input = ref entity.Get<InputComponent>();
            ref var position = ref entity.Get<PositionComponent>();
            ref var velocity = ref entity.Get<VelocityComponent>();
            ref var stats = ref entity.Get<PlayerStatsComponent>();
            
            // Apply input to velocity
            Vector3 targetVelocity = new Vector3(input.movement.x, input.movement.y, 0) * stats.moveSpeed;
            velocity.value = targetVelocity;
            
            // Apply velocity to position

            // Check collision with obstacles
            bool collision = false;
            ref var playerCollider = ref entity.Get<ColliderComponent>();
            
            foreach (var obstacle in this.obstacleFilter) {
                ref var obstaclePos = ref obstacle.Get<PositionComponent>();
                ref var obstacleCollider = ref obstacle.Get<ColliderComponent>();
                
                float distance = Vector3.Distance(newPosition, obstaclePos.value);
                float minDistance = playerCollider.radius + obstacleCollider.radius;
                
                if (distance < minDistance) {

## üîå Networking Implementation Details

### ME.ECS and Photon Integration

ME.ECS provides deterministic simulation with rollback capability, which is crucial for networked games. We'll integrate it with Photon using the following approach:

1. **Network Module**
   - Create a custom ME.ECS module that interfaces with Photon
   - Handle serialization of game state for network transmission
   - Manage client-server communication

2. **State Synchronization**
   - Use ME.ECS's built-in state management for rollbacks
   - Sync only essential data (inputs, random seeds) over the network
   - Leverage determinism to ensure consistent state across clients

3. **Input Handling**
   - Collect and buffer local player inputs
   - Transmit inputs to other clients via Photon events
   - Apply remote inputs in correct simulation ticks

### Network Architecture

We'll implement a client-authoritative model with server validation, where:

1. Each client owns their player entity and processes inputs locally
2. Input commands are sent to all clients via Photon
3. All clients simulate the game deterministically based on the same inputs
4. ME.ECS handles state rollbacks when late inputs arrive

```csharp
// Example Photon-ME.ECS bridge
public class PhotonNetworkModule : INetworkModule {
    private PhotonView photonView;
    private Queue<NetworkCommand> commandQueue = new Queue<NetworkCommand>();
    
    public void OnConstruct(World world) {
        // Initialize Photon components
        photonView = FindObjectOfType<PhotonView>();
        
        // Register Photon callbacks
        PhotonNetwork.NetworkingClient.EventReceived += OnNetworkEvent;
    }
    
    public void OnDeconstruct() {
        PhotonNetwork.NetworkingClient.EventReceived -= OnNetworkEvent;
    }
    
    // Send command to network
    public void SendCommand(NetworkCommand command) {
        byte[] data = SerializeCommand(command);
        
        // Use Photon RaiseEvent to send to all clients
        RaiseEventOptions options = new RaiseEventOptions { Receivers = ReceiverGroup.All };
        PhotonNetwork.RaiseEvent(NetEventCode.GameCommand, data, options, SendOptions.SendReliable);
    }
    
    // Process received network events
    private void OnNetworkEvent(EventData eventData) {
        if (eventData.Code == NetEventCode.GameCommand) {
            byte[] data = (byte[])eventData.CustomData;
            NetworkCommand command = DeserializeCommand(data);
            
            // Add to command queue for processing in simulation
            commandQueue.Enqueue(command);
        }
    }
    
    // Process queued commands during simulation
    public void ProcessCommands(World world) {
        while (commandQueue.Count > 0) {
            var command = commandQueue.Dequeue();
            ApplyCommand(world, command);
        }
    }
    
    // Apply a command to the world state
    private void ApplyCommand(World world, NetworkCommand command) {
        // Process command based on type
        switch (command.type) {
            case CommandType.PlayerInput:
                ApplyInputCommand(world, command);
                break;
            case CommandType.PlayerSpawn:
                SpawnPlayer(world, command);
                break;
            // Other command types...
        }
    }
}
```
